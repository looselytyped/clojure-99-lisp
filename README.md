# com-looselytyped-99problems

This is an attempt at solving the [99-Lisp-Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) in Clojure.

I have two solutions for each one - One that attempts at using pure recursion and lists, and an 'idiomatic' version that uses 'the Clojure way'. 

Needless to say, I am hoping, and expecting that the *idiomatic* version changes over time as I get more experience with Clojure.
